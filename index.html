            <p>
              My name is Nicky Stevens. I am a graduate of the SheCodes coding
              bootcamp, a front-end developer, and an information management
              professional based in Florida, USA. With a Bachelor degree in
              film, a minor in history, and a Masters in Library and Information
              Science, making information available in creative, organized, and
              user-friendly ways is a passion of mine.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have knowledge of multiple markup and programming languages,
              including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, as well as experience
              with Bootstrap, APIs, AI technology, development workflow,
              hosting, and data manipulation. In addition, I have been managing
              information in the library and archives fields for 14 years.
              Through the years I have honed my skills in information
              management, databases, reference services, research, education,
              and customer service making sure users, whether public citizens,
              corporate customers, academic researchers, or professional
              colleauges, have the information they need.
